    <h3> ONLINE CALCULATOR</h3>
    <p>Electronic calculators have been around since the early 1960s. Early models were designed to handle basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication <br>
        Over time, they were developed to perform more sophisticated functions, such as trigonometric, statistical, and algebraic equations (e.g. graphing, differentiation, integration).<br>
       In turn, an online calculator has a different purpose: it is an interactive software tool that is designed to process a predefined set of mathematical functions in order to simulate a business process.
     <br>Rather than the end user defining the operation, the toolâ€™s designer is responsible for generating the calculation model.
     <br> This helps abstract away the mathematical and logical complexity, leaving the end user with a simpler interface that adapts more clearly to their specific interest or expertise.</p>

 <h3>HOW DO YOU BUILD AN ONLINE CALCULATOR?</h3>
 <p>Before we break down how to build an online calculator, it is important to understand the overarching composition of one. There are two primary components of an online calculator:

   <li> The user interface </li>
   <li>The calculation algorithm</li>
    The user interface is how the end user interacts with the online calculator. It includes a set of input controls, where the user will be prompted to enter data  e.g. textboxes. 
    <br>It may provide explanations and hints to the end user for how to perform specific operations. It may validate user entry to prevent out-of-scope or invalid data collection.<br>
    Additionally, it will likely display calculation results in a variety of forms, such as charts, tables, and documents.</p>
